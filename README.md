# BLAEQ_CUDA
The code to our submitted paper to VLDB 2025 titled BLAEQ: Efficient on-GPU Spatial Range Query of Large-scale CFD Mesh using BLAS

The code is fully implemented in CUDA C/C++.

# Requirements
The following requirements must be met:

Hardware:

    An NVIDIA GPU supporting CUDA.

Environment:
    
    -CUDA
